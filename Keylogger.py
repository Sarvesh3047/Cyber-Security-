@ What this code does 
# This Python code creates a file named ABC.txt, and all the keys pressed by the victim on their keyboard will be saved in that file.
# The code runs in the background, and even if the compiler window is minimized, the code continues running.
# It only stops when the compiler or script is closed.
# This file can be made to run automatically if the attacker converts the script into a .exe file and sets it as an auto-execution task in the Task Scheduler.

@ Use case of this code 
#1️⃣. Ethical Purposes (Authorized & Legal Use Cases)

#System Security Audits
#Organizations use keyloggers in controlled environments to monitor and audit employee behavior, ensuring compliance with security policies and detecting potential insider threats.

#Parental Control
#Parents may use keyloggers (with proper consent and ethical use) to monitor children’s computer usage and ensure they are not accessing harmful content.

#User Behavior Analysis (Research)
#In usability testing or research studies, authorized keyloggers can help researchers understand how users interact with software or websites by analyzing their typing patterns.

#Forensic Investigation
#Digital forensic investigators can use keyloggers (under legal authority) to reconstruct events leading to a security breach or criminal activity by capturing all user interactions.

# 2️⃣. Unethical and Illegal Purposes (Illegal Use Cases)

#Spying on Others Without Consent
#Installing a keylogger secretly to steal sensitive personal data like passwords, credit card numbers, private messages, etc., is highly illegal and unethical.

#Corporate Espionage
#Malicious actors may use keyloggers to steal confidential business information, trade secrets, or intellectual property from competitors.

#Identity Theft and Financial Fraud
#Cybercriminals use keyloggers to capture login credentials and sensitive information, leading to identity theft, unauthorized bank transactions, and fraud.

#Unauthorized Access
#Attackers may use keyloggers to gain unauthorized access to secured systems by capturing authentication credentials.
